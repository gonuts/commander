go-commander
============

``go-commander`` is a spin off of [golang](http://golang.org) ``go tool`` infrastructure to provide commands and sub-commands.

A ``commander.Commander`` has a ``Commands`` field holding ``[]*commander.Command`` subcommands, referenced by name from the command line and an optional ``[]*commander.Commander`` ``Commanders`` field for nested commanders.

So a ``Commander`` can have sub commanders.

An example is provided by the [hwaf](https://github.com/mana-fwk/hwaf) command.

So you can have, /e.g./
```sh
$ mycmd action1 [options...]
$ mycmd subcmd1 action1 [options...]
```

## Documentation
Is available on [godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/sbinet/go-commander)

## TODO
